# leaflet-challenge
Interactive maps were constructed using Leaflet to plot earthquakes from a JSON dataset that was sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
D3 was used to connect to the GeoJSON API.
These maps include information about the depth and magnitude of the earthquakes using scaled markers displaying the size of the earthquake with a legend showing corresponding colors to measure the depth of each event.
